Wash\n\nEvery time I wash the dog at home I wreak havoc on two different bathrooms and by the end my dog still smells like someone with B.O. who just sprayed on some cologne.  And because I have a dog instead of children, I'm way too nice - that hose water is waaaay too cold.  So I dump warm bathwater on him and his under-sides never get clean.\n\nWag n Wash provides a solution.  I mess up their place, not mine.  I use their warm-water hose to clean his underside.  Then I blow hair all over their establishment, instead of all over my bathroom.\n\nPaying someone else to wash the dog is preferred, but this is a reasonably priced alternative that works better than a home wash.\n\n2.  Food/Accessories\n\nMy dog eats healthier than I do, so I overpay for fancy food that uses ingredients I can actually pronounce.  Wag n Wash prices are equal to or less than Petco for my Solid Gold Wolf King - and I take comfort that my payments are going to a small business and not to a large corporation majority owned by some prince from a large oil producing country.  And their acessories are great too."",), ('According to the adage, fools rush in where angels fear to tread. And so, only after my girlfriend and I suddenly found ourselves the new owners of a 6-week old Shih-Tzu puppy at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, did we begin to realize the magnitude of our predicament.  Wag N\' Wash is on our drive home, so we called them to see if they were still open, and they informed us that they would be closing at 6:00.  We hurried there, hoping we could make it before they closed.\n\nOur experience was top-notch.  Although we got there a few minutes before 6:00, nobody raised an eyebrow.  Employees at many places would resent having to help a customer who showed up at closing time, and would rush that customer.  Not here.  There were four employees cleaning and tidying up.  They all came over to meet our new family addition, and were genuinely happy to help us put together a ""puppy starter kit.""  Their suggestions were particularly helpful to me, as a first-time dog owner.  Even the groomer who was still there came out to meet her, and offered up a ""sanitary"" clipping and wash.  \n\nOn Sunday, we commented several times about how much harder it would have been to have gotten through the first night if the good folks at Wag N\' Wash hadn\'t been so awesome.  So we went back!',), (""After hitting some other places and experiencing Wag N' Wash more I have to lower my rating. There are two main issues that annoy me. \n\nThe staff pay is apparently commission, or at least sales, based. Which means that they will not leave you alone to just look around and make a decision about products! This would be less annoying if they were trained better I have received conflicting information from two different staff members about the same product...that raises a flag. One of them is wrong but they are really trying to sell stuff to you!\n\nFurthermore, their dog wash area is nice and well kept. However the dog baths require you to get your dog into them. Which is tricky if you have a big dog, especially after the wash when the floor is wet and you have to get the dog out. After my first experience, when my dog slipped, I asked a staff member if their was a better way that might keep my dog from hitting his legs when he slipped...they just nonchalantly said that it was what happened all the time.\n\nEven better, the drying area is separate from the washing area and requires you to take your wet dog into another room, lift them onto another platform and then use the driers on them. Why not just dry them in the tub?\n\nI'd suggest going to Smelly Dog up the street, their tubs lift up for you and you dry the dog right there, also their staff is happier and friendlier!"",), (""After our 6-year-old cat had to be rushed to the vet with a urinary blockage earlier this year, we went online and did some research about the best type of cat foods.

We've tried Petsmart, and they did an ok job, but it took almost four hours. I was hoping Wag 'N Wash would beat that.\n\nNot only did Wag 'N Wash come in under half of Petsmart's time, they were cheaper by a good $20, and Mulder looks amazing! When I dropped him off at his appointment time, he seemed really hesitant to comply with Lydia, and it took a lot of willpower to leave him on the grooming table, but when I came back an hour and 15 minutes later, Mulder looked like his cheerful, happy self, but obviously happy to see me. Lydia said he was a great boy and was wonderful. I paid at the counter and declined a baked good - Mulder always gets an upset stomach from new food.\n\nI am very impressed with Mulder's new 'do. He's all thinned out and trimmed up for summer, and Lydia trimmed the hair on his little boy dingy like I asked, plus the fluffies in between his toe pads. She did a thorough and fabulous job. I've had dogs come back from the groomer's positively traumatized, but Mulder has been his normal self, so I assume her friendliness toward Mulder didn't mysteriously stop as soon as I was gone. I also appreciate that I can go into the grooming area with the pros, not like at Petsmart where I have to stay on the other side of the gate. We will definitely be back!\n\nMy only complaint about Wag 'N Wash is how the owners tried to sell me on their food the first time I was there. My dogs have been eating Nutripet for years and years, and I am extremely happy about it. I don't appreciate being lectured on the amount of carbohydrates and protein, as if this is not information I have considered on my own. I don't buy cheap food - I make sure my dogs are getting what they need to be healthy, so please don't treat me like I am an uninformed purveyor of Kibbles N Bits or Pedigree.

Although Robert was scheduled to leave town for a week, we decided to give Max a chance that Friday night and he's blended perfectly into our home. Brady now has a new brother and I'm happy to report that they have grown rather attached.] Needless to say, we're still on the learning curve when it comes to Max's temperament, which was rather challenged in the presence of so many dogs Saturday. But, true to form, the staff remained encouraging (unlike some of the queenie bitches who weren't on leashes) and gave us hope that Max, like Brady, will be able to mellow out. \n\nBoth of our kids had lovely, customized baths (Brady went for sleek and shiny while Max opted for citrus wash) which we were able to administer at our leisure. A bucket of washing goodies was brought out--brushes, shampoo, cream rinse, leave-in conditioner, towels and a wash cloth. The attendants were there to answer any questions along the way. The drying stations are separate from the washing basins, which was different from SD, but makes sense since now. \n\nWhile I agree some of the prices are on the high end, I'd much rather invest my money with a smaller business then dump my paycheck into Wal-Mart.

Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn\'t afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.\n\nBut when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".\n\nShe\'s a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.\n\n""Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits""?\n\nDude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae.',), (""I will never bring my Shih Zhus to this place again. Avoid Holly!

Instead of wrestling with him in the bathtub at my home, I figured it would be easier to take him to a DIY place. I went to Wag 'n Wash and opted for the basic, which is around $13. This included; towels, brushes, shampoo & conditioner, an apron, and drying station. \n\nI start the cleaning process by putting my dog in the tub. This was not an easy task being that the tub is 2 feet off of the ground, my puppy is 70 lbs. and I'm clearly not a weight lifter. Fortunately one of the staff members helped me get my puppy into the tub, it still wasn't easy, but we eventually got him in there. So I get him washed and clean, and then he needed to be dried. So I again, have the task of getting 70 lbs. of puppy out of the tub and into the dryer area (quite the struggle). I get him over to the dryer area and realize again, that I will have to lift him up another 2 feet so I can use the dryer. This time he's sopping wet, fortunately one of the staff members again helped me lift him up, but it was still a struggle as his was slipping, sliding, resisting and then resulted in being sopping wet myself. I then attempted to dry him while simultaneously trying to keep him from jumping off of the 2 foot platform, since the leash that was connected kept loosening due to my dogs weight. After a while, I just gave up and left him half dry as it was too much of a struggle. \n\nI'm not sure if I would attempt to do this again, as I went here because I thought it would be easier than doing it at home by myself. It seems as if this place is not setup for large dog breeds, maybe if they added some step stools it would've been less of a challenge.

The baked doggie goods smelled so good, I wanted to eat some. The staff were friendly and helpful, I'll be back."",), ('There is so much crap out there for your dog, and the big stores don\'t have it all. Luckily there\'s Wag N Wash!\n\nFirst there\'s food.  Honestly most of it is awful. Why do people scrimp on dog food, ie; Science Diet, Purina, Beneful, Alpo, etc. These foods aren\'t good for your dog! Since when do dogs eat wheat? Rice? Do wolves and wild dogs eat those fillers? No they don\'t, so why feed it to your dogs? In my experience, if you feed your dog right your never going to the vet, really. Wag N Wash offers the best dog foods, at great prices. Foods such as Innova, Evo, Karma and California Natural (here is the website address: http://www.naturapet.com/). They also have raw food for your pooch for those extremists out there! Feed your dog well and he or she will be happier, live longer and rarely go to the vet! \n\nSecond is toys! Wag N Wash does toys well. Lots of stimulating toys that you can\'t find at most stores, big or small. Toys for dogs are important, unless you don\'t mind chewed couches, shoes, etc. Toys stimulate your pooch, they keep them happy!\n\nThirdly the staff rocks! They are very helpful as well as knowledgeable. They seem to be too nice, if only all restaurants greet there custumers as well as Wag N Wash! \n\nFunny thing though, I\'ve never washed my doggie there. So I can\'t rate the wash aspect, maybe one day I\'ll take on the ""tubs n suds"", when I do I\'ll update. \n\nBy the way yes, they do have cat food, toys, etc too!\n\nWag N Wash is in a few markets in the US, they also have a website that could be more helpful........... http://wagnwash.com/',), ('This is a great place, and the verity of services/goods offered makes this the ideal choice for all of our pets needs.\nFive stars!!!',), ('This is a great place.

They use all natural products & offer great baked goods, made especially for dogs. I always get my dogs a couple of them afterwards as a treat for being so good. There is also a cute resident schnauzer who wanders around the place. The only down side is the price. It's a bit expensive, so we don't go super often.

My roommate took me here on saturday and i was pretty excited when I arrived.  They had his and hers fire hydrants out front, which is pretty cool.  I peed on one and we made our way inside.  First we checked out the food section. They carry my favorite brand, Taste of the Wild.  (Previously I had only found this at Kodi\'s on 16th St. and Bethany.)   Then I perused the accessories.  Nice necklaces and pretty awesome toys.  I found a super cool Stegasauraus and carried it around for a while. \n\nThen my rooomate says, ""hey, let\'s go check out the back.""  The back?  There\'s more to this awesome place?  Heck yes, let\'s go!   And then everything changed....  The door swung open to the back of the store.  I heard other guys in there crying.  What the hell was going on?  \n\nMy roommate picked me up and put me into this steel box.  Some sort of medieval torture device.  (Dude, i thought we were cool, wtf?!)   Then he puts on an apron and gets to work.  Splash, bam, boom.... water torture!  Its a nightmare. Soap everywhere, i tried to escape but i was tied down.  After what felt like 14 years he turned off the water started to towel dry me off.  Then he gave me some cologne.  (That doesnt make this okay bro.)\n\nFinally i made my exit and back to the ""front"" of the store.  I rushed around and tried to warn all the other dudes and bitches in there, but none of them listened.  I think a few actually enjoyed that room.  Masochists.  \n\nSo I made my roommate buy me some gourmet snacks.  Peanut Butter stars were good, but the little Cinnamon Rolls were my favorite.  I also got 2 frozen bison bones with marrow... which i intend on eating on my roommates bed and pillow as revenge.

The facility is always clean, easy to use and the employees are super helpful (and seem to really enjoy their jobs). They have everything you could need to groom, including toothbrushes, brushes, and towels/dryers. I always go with the basic wash and have been very happy with it (about $15). Their pricing is the same no matter the size/breed. My dog is about 45 pounds so for me it's worth it but might not be if you have a tiny dog. \n\nThe food/treats are great too.

THEY ABUSED MY DOGS!\n\nI went to Smelly Dog for the first time this past week and I was told over the phone when I called ahead that there was no appointment necessary for the full dog wash (done by staff) and that it typically took one hour or so to complete. I showed up there with my two dogs and there was one car in the parking lot. It was empty inside except for the clerk who was busy putting together a small gift box and continued to do for about two minutes before she finally greeted me. I told her I was a first time customer but she didn\'t thank me for coming in or explain to me anything about how the process there works.

She was rude and not friendly and I just got a weird feeling about her.\n\nEither way, she took my two dogs back into the wash room and put a small leash around their necks and hooked them to a wall to wait to be washed. THe clerk told me it would be about an hour. My boyfriend and I went out to lunch and returned 50 minutes later. As I was walking up to the store I looked through the window to see if I could see my dogs in the back room. They were in the same exact spot that I left them in 50 minutes earlier. My older dog WITH CANCER currently on chemotherapy had peed herself and my younger dog was shaking with her tail between her legs.

There was literally not one single car in the parking lot when I first arrived or when I came back. There was one dog waiting in a pin. There were two other workers walking around the back. I was FURIOUS. I took my dogs right out of there and took them home to bath them myself.\n\nI WILL NEVER EVER TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH MY DOGS AGAIN! THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM LEAVING MY DOGS IN THE HOT WASHROOM STANDING FOR AN HOUR WITH NO WATER.\n\nThe clerk was so unfriendly and awkward.

But here at Smelly Dog, the staff and owner immediately put her at ease by acknowledging her, giving her a playful pet, and giving the lovable ""who\'s a smelly doggy?"" act.  I was impressed by the sincerity of it all, as dogs can see right through all of that, but each and every animal responded enthusiastically to the playfulness.  \n\nThey have self-wash stations set up for the owners to rinse, shampoo, condition, blow-dry, brush, and spritz their dog.

After reading the reviews, I was just about ready to load up my poochie until I read that the dogs must be lifted into the wash bins.  Me being a scrawny 125 pounds, I knew I\'d nearly kill myself trying to lift my 85 and 100 pound dogs. I know I could have asked for assistance, but my dogs don\'t like being handled by anyone other than myself.  I then read that Smelly Dog had hydraulic wash tubs that could be lowered  to where the dogs could walk right in.  This alone made me switch my destination to Smelly Dog.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by two friendly receptionists. I didn\'t have an appointment, and that wasn\'t an issue at all. They checked me in and immediately began setting up a tub for me. Once they finished, they attached a collar to my dog and  walked us back to the tub, which I\'m assuming have been upgraded based off of other reviews. The tubs were metal and definitely durable. She then showed me how to work the remote for the tub, how to work the hose and explained the array of products/tools I was given (Apron, shampoo, conditioner, ear cleaner/cotton balls, a gentle face wash, towels, a few brushes/combs (one of which was a sudsing brush which was MIA in another review)  and blow dryer).\n\nAs soon as my Yoshi girl entered the tub, we realized there was a problem. She is an awkward height, so when we attached her to the restraint, it was either too lax, which meant she could easily jump out, or it was too tight to where she could not stand up without having to keep her head down.  The receptionist helped me find a way to restrain her to provide her comfort and to also prevent her from flopping out of the tub. \n\nWash Time! The hose was very easy to use and had many different settings. The pressure was good and the water temperature is controlled, so no need to tinker around with a ""hot/cold"" knob. The shampoo and conditioner are in what appears to be condiment bottles, which provides very easy application. The products are all natural and high quality that work and smell great! The dryer was also easy to use.  It has a high and low setting. Yoshi is very timid, so I used the low setting and she did fine.\n\nOnce I finished, asked the staff if they would be able to make accommodations for my other German Shepherd, Ben. Ben is aggressive and does not like unfamiliar people at all, so I was nervous to bring him in. They assured me they\'ve seen it all, and offered to set me up a tub in the far corner so the number of people passing by would be limited. I was also allowed to pre-pay for his wash to limit the amount of time he would have to be in the lobby.  By the time I dropped off Yoshi and returned with Ben, the tub was already set up. They allowed me to walk back to the tub and restrain him myself which is exactly what I wanted to do as this prevented any unnecessary barking or growling.\n\nAfter washing my Benny boy up (he did EXCELLENT by the way! Proud mama!), we returned to the lobby. I was approached by Jackie (owner/manager??) and she recommended an awesome oatmeal shampoo for my very itchy Jack Russell at home (already used it, he smells so yummy!), as well as some grain-free foods (all were reasonably priced too!). I was nervous because of  how close Jackie was standing to Ben, but much to my surprise, instead of barking at her like he does with nearly anyone who else who stands too close, he jumped up and licked her all over her face!! AMAZING! She obviously presented herself in a way that wasn\'t threatening. Major Plus!\n\nI\'ll definitely return! Awesome staff, very user-friendly equipment. Totally worth $15 bucks each.

It is not uncommon to be on a leash (pun intended) for up to six hours, awaiting that phone call for return pick-up.  But Smelly Dog has broken that standard!

When the clerk finally got off the phone she did apologize and then told me she was talking to the owner who wanted an update on the happenings of the store - I think the priority in this case should have been the customer standing in front of her.

I think they have a self-wash area too. \n\nThe staff has always been incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about their products. \n\nI\'m not sure what all the negative reviews are about - but it seems that this place is in new hands now.',), ('New to AZ and was very satisfied with the end result. Our little dog looks great and they were very thorough in communication with me on what I wanted. Lots of great treats and retail to choose from too!! Definitely recommend.',), ('Not my first time here. Make an appointment, very accommodating and nice folks. \n\nSweet to my dog, she is very excited to go and looks great when I pick her up. They have always been prompt in my experience.',), (""Oh this place is fun if your doggie needs a haircut and or bath.  It's like a SALON FOR DOGS!  For real.... the groomers have the place set up like a real salon and they are chatting and cuting my dog's hair-- it's so flippin' cute!  Sophie, the Golden, loves this place and she likes Wag N Wash.\n\nI have not been to Smelly Dog in awhile though b/c we've been going to Wag N Wash.  I hope Smelly Dog is still open now that I think about it."",)]","[(165479,), (165480,), (165481,), (165482,), (165483,), (165484,), (165485,), (165486,), (165487,), (165488,), (165489,), (165490,), (165491,), (165492,), (165493,), (165494,), (165495,), (165496,), (165497,), (165498,), (165499,), (165500,), (165501,), (165502,), (165503,), (165504,), (165505,), (165506,), (165507,), (165508,), (165509,), (165510,), (165511,), (165512,), (172065,), (172066,), (172067,), (172068,), (172069,), (172070,), (173934,), (173935,), (173936,), (173937,), (173938,), (173939,), (173940,), (173941,), (173942,), (173943,), (173944,), (173945,), (173946,), (173947,), (173948,), (173949,), (173950,), (173951,), (177125,), (177126,), (177127,), (177128,), (177129,), (177130,), (177131,), (177132,), (177133,), (177134,), (177135,), (177136,), (177137,), (177138,), (177139,), (177140,), (177141,), (177142,), (177143,), (177144,), (177145,), (177146,), (177147,), (177148,), (177149,), (177150,), (177151,), (177152,), (177153,), (177154,), (177155,), (177156,), (177157,), (178029,), (178030,), (178031,), (178032,), (178033,), (178034,), (178035,), (178036,), (178037,), (178038,), (178039,), (178040,), (178041,), (178042,), (178043,), (178044,), (178045,), (178046,), (178047,), (178048,), (178049,), (178050,), (178051,), (178052,), (178053,), (178054,), (181549,), (181550,), (181551,), (181552,), (181553,), (181554,), (181555,), (181556,), (181557,), (181558,), (181559,), (181560,), (181561,), (181562,), (181563,), (181564,), (181565,), (181566,), (181567,), (181568,), (181569,), (181570,), (181571,), (181572,), (181573,), (181574,), (181575,), (181576,), (181577,), (181578,), (181579,), (181580,), (181581,), (181582,), (181583,), (181584,), (181585,), (181586,), (181587,), (181588,), (181589,), (181590,), (181591,), (181592,), (181593,), (181594,), (181595,), (181596,), (181597,), (181598,), (181599,), (181600,), (181601,), (181602,), (181603,), (181604,), (181605,), (181606,), (181607,), (181608,), (181609,), (181610,), (181611,), (181612,), (181613,), (181614,), (181615,), (181616,), (181617,), (181618,), (181619,), (181620,), (181621,), (181622,), (181623,), (181624,), (181625,), (181626,), (181627,), (181628,), (181629,), (181630,), (181631,)]",False

My favorite cocktail is a Gibson (basically a martini but with cocktail onions instead of olives), and I was surprised that both the waitress and the bartender knew what it was! Most restaurants don't even stock those onions anymore. Things were off to a good start. \n\nMy friend and I shared a fried calamari appetizer and an order of stuffed hot peppers. I really enjoyed Bravo Franco's tomato sauce; it was very rich, just like I like it. I also enjoyed a legitimate Caesar salad with anchovies and some really good croutons. Bravo Franco feels like a nice, old-time Italian restaurant, and the helpful staff, good food, and proximity to Heinz Hall combine to make it a new favorite of mine."",), (""After subpar service, my tables server then told us she did not give back our change because it is not Bravo Franco's policy to give back change when the meal is paid for in cash.

Also I did not finish my entire sea food pasta so I had it put in a to go box. When the box was placed on the table it was standing straight up so all the sauce was leaking out of the box. When I got home I went to clean up the mess and realized that not all my sea food was in the box. I was missing oysters and muscles but one scallop and the noodles remained. I can understand it getting busy in the kitchen and there being confusion and possibly receiving the wrong meal but that was not the case, I got only half of my meal back. Mind you that my friends and I are teenagers, this waitress treated us without respect and tried to take advantage of our age.

The owner kindly welcomed us on and sat us, we were coming from an alumni event for our college and had some friends straggling behind. The waitress started off kind and took our drink orders. She then proceeded to tell us at 915 that our friends needed to hurry up because the owner needed them to place the order. I told her they were on their way and would be here shortly. I kept seeing her from the register looking over at us with a scowl and then screamed across the dining room to me that they needed to hurry up and get here. I explained to her I had placed the food order with another waitress. When she came back over with our salads, my friend asked her if we were a burden to her and she said no but the owner wanted to shut the burners off. I said I work at a bank in customer service and even if a person comes in before closing time we accommodate their needs and I questioned as to why they were turning the burners off at 930 when they closed at 11. After that discussion with the waitress she became evil, her responses were short and nasty, then she sent another waitress over to finish off our table. Our food was basically dropped in front of us, no one ever asked throughout our meal if everything was ok or if we needs anything else. The food came out so quickly as well that I questioned whether or not it was freshly made to order. The owner came over to apologize and said she would accommodate us. Our waitress then was telling all the restaurant staff members about our table and said some pretty nasty things which I could hear and see her doing from my seat. So unprofessional. This is the type of place that has staff members who would spit in your food and don't have a solid management structure to guide them.

It came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette that was pretty tasteless.  The chicken parmigiana was just okay.  Nothing standout, and dare I say, Olive Garden has a better chicken parmigiana.  The entree came with a side of ziti that was decent, but nothing special.

Bravo Franco was one of the only places left that seemed to have availability.  When we arrived, the place was a ghost town.  There may have been one other table seated, and this was during peak lunch hour!  Not a good sign.\n\nThe decor in here is a bit dated and was probably very nice in the late nineties or early 2000\'s, but now it just feels a bit stuffy and out of touch.\n\nWe were promptly seated and presented with menus.  The lunch selection was reasonable and I was happy to find a variety of items for different tastes and palates available.   A quick rundown of what I saw and what I tried:\n\n1 ) Sauteed Calamari appetizer - The sauce on this was great.  It had a nice, fresh tomato taste with just the right amount of kick.  Sadly, the calamari was way over cooked.  The pasta sauce flavor dissipated long before mastication had completed, leaving me chewing fishy rubber bands for an extra 30 seconds.  Yikes.\n\n2) Franco salad - I might not be spot on with the name here, but it was a gargantuan combo that looked like a strange antipasto platter/shrimp cocktail/lettuce/caprese frankenstein.  It looked good and there was quite a bit of food on there, but the presentation was a bit odd and didn\'t really strike me as being a ""salad"". \n\n3) Chicken Romano - I didn\'t eat this, but the presentation was so sparse!  Two pieces of chicken on a plate.  That\'s it.  Garnish?  Side veggie?  Something!? Anything.  I don\'t care how good the chicken was, the plate was just boring, even if it did come with a side soup or salad.\n\n4) Sirloin Burger - This was actually pretty good.  Hand-formed patty? Check.  Cooked to specified level of done-ness?  Check?  Onions and mushrooms?  Yep.  But you forgot the cheese I asked for on top.  Oh well, it was still good.  Maybe a lil\' salt and pepper though.\n\nLast but not least, the service was not good.  Our waitress was prompt enough, but her clear lack of menu knowledge was a definite deal breaker.  I\'ve had plenty of potentially mediocre experiences turned around by waitstaff that knows the killer entree recommendation that saves the day.

I\'m very happy that the person I made the reservation with suggested 6pm for an 8pm show, becuause we didn\'t get out of the restaurant until 7:45pm.  \n\nIn summary, based on my one experience, I strongly discourage anyone from trying Bravo Franco.  The food was bland and our service was terrible.  \n\nWe started with the Fried Zucchini (I had heard that it is a specialty of the Pittsburgh Theater District, so we had to try it).  It was good, it came out quickly, and was way too much food for two people.  After the appetizer, we should have received our salads pretty quickly, however we sat there for 15 minutes, waiting for a busboy or our waiter to clear the appetizer and bring us our salads.  \n\nWhen they finally did arrive, they became a highlight of the night.  I had a caesar, my wife the house.  I really enjoyed the caesar dressing, although the croutons were burnt.  \n\nThe wait in-between the salads and entrees wasn\'t too long, my guess is that was because of the extra long wait earlier.    My osso-buco was very tender, but had very little flavor.  My wife\'s lobster ravioli on the other hand had plenty of flavor, unfortunately the flavor was ""too-fishy"".\n\nAt this point we were both very disappointed.  However, I was resolved to try dessert, as I had read that their Tiramisù was excellent.  It was 6:50pm, and I thought that was more than enough time.  This was another big mistake.  It took over 15 minutes for them to clear our entree plates and bring us dessert menus, and almost 15 more minutes for the desserts to come out.  Luckily we asked for our check when dessert arrived, and had paid by the time we were finished eating.\n\nMy wife ordered the Tiramisù, and I ordered the Creme Caramel.  I enjoyed mine a lot, but the Tiramisù was awful.  I swear, it was covered in HERSHEY\'S SYRUP.

Well there is good and not-so-good at Bravo Franco Ristorante.\n\nThe location is perfectly situated in the cultural district and very convenient. They seem to have squeezed in as many tables as is physically possible so it is cramped and noisy.

The decor is a bit dated and it has an old-school feel to it, but that is not a big deal.  Two stars for the restaurant.\n\nThe service. Well, first is that they take your coat whether you want them to or not. Our waitress was a bit grumpy, impatient, and seemed like she really needed a change of career. She was almost combative when the wife asked about which she could eat with her gluten allergy and it was only when she handed me the check that she made an effort to be friendly. She also kept putting her hand on my shoulder and calling me ""hon"" which seemed really awkward being that she was so grumpy. They seemed a bit understaffed.  Two stars for service.\n\nNow to the food. There were a lot of selections, although none were vegetarian. The salad greens were perfect and the clam chowder was well prepared and not overly salty as is common at many places. My linguini with red clam sauce was wonderful but a bit overpriced at $18.95. The wife had gluten-free pasta with tomato basil sauce and, despite the difficulties with the ordering gluten free food, she was pleased with the dish. The homemade tiramisu worked and the coffee was  a nice mild Italian roast. All-in-all the food was 4 stars.\n\nI would not go to this restaurant if you want to be able to carry on a conversation, have food allergies, are claustrophobic, have small children, or are on a tight budget. But if you have tickets to a nearby show and want some good Italian food this might be a good choice.',), ('While the location of this restaurant is superb, the food is pretty good and the service average.\nI saw ""Wicked"" at the Benedum and we ate here first.

Young girl beside me was texting and I could have read her texts if I wanted too.\n\nChicken Piccatta was very good. Veal special was equally good. House salad dressing was described to me by the waiter as "" a balsamic vinegrette with dry bleu cheese crumbles"". Perfect for me and my guest.

Apparently, the way the tv is being packaged (as I looked at the same model Samsung LED smart tv replacement I just got from the store) , there was no styrofoam/ styropor in place in the upper middle part of the tv to protect it inside the box. So if the upper middle part of the tv / box is banged to something really hard, the tv would have the tendency to be cracked in that upper middle area. That is what happened to the tv I purchased. When I called bestbuy.com\'s customer service, 2 of them just told me and my husband that they cant do anything as more than 60 days had passed after purchase date  and that it is their policy that they could only replace it with 60 days.  I totally understand that, but my point is that they could have at least checked my credibility, looked at my account as well as my husband\'s ( I guess we are "" preferred bestbuy reward members"" or whatever they call it), checked  the packaging as I tried to explain it to them how it was packaged or if not, at least tried to refer us to somebody who could help. I was really upset about this incident that I was even thinking of consulting it to a lawyer.

RAW SEWAGE is considered acceptable and unworthy of a comp. Since 0 or negative stars aren\'t an option, 1 star is the lowest rating I can give. Check in Wednesday, October 8th: informed our room wasn\'t available and we were offered a larger room at the same rate, and a later check out time. The ""larger room"" was 2 floors below with a ""view"" of the rooftop generators. When we tried to use the jacuzzi tub, raw sewage started bubbling from the shower drain and bar sink. The smell was nauseating as you can imagine, and when we reported this to the hotel maintenance they didn\'t arrive for 2 HOURS! After our flight we just wanted to relax in our room. Unfortunately, our room smelled like a cesspool and the rattle and hum of the generators was constant and annoying. Also the carpet by the sink, was saturated which we believed was from the shower drain, but was assured it was a leak from the fridge. When maintenance arrived they were unable to fix the sewage leak, so we were relocated AGAIN to another room. Although the plumbing worked, we were on a lower floor and directly across from the rooftop generators. (Stratosphere was aware of a plumbing issue between the 3-13 floors because we were advised that the plumbing would be turned off for 3 hours on Thursday for ""maintenance."") After speaking to ""hotel management"" we were assured that we would be comped our first night\'s stay, since we had to change our rooms twice due to their mistakes. The generator\'s rumblings were louder due to them being directly outside our window, but at least our room didn\'t wreak of sewage. When we checked out Friday, we were under the impression that we would be comped the first night due to the phone call we received, but were advised they weren\'t aware of any issue despite the fact our hotel resort fee was refunded. Why would the resort fee be refunded unless there was an issue? You weren\'t AWARE of it and it wasn\'t NOTED anywhere? That sounds pretty suspicious to me. After explaining our situation to the supervisor, she said they don\'t do room comps, but could offer a later check out time. I again mentioned the raw sewage and she retorted that they don\'t comp out rooms. Since our flight wasn\'t until 8pm, we decided to take the late check out and drop our luggage off in the room. We were assured that our old key cards would work. Surprise, surprise, the keys were deactivated and we had to fall back in line to reactivate our keys. While we were in our room changing into our street clothes, maintenance knocked on our door because our check in was still noted at 1pm and not 5pm. We had to inform him that our check out time was changed recently, but they didn\'t bother to inform him. In conclusion, don\'t book at Stratosphere. You will NOT get the room you book, just whatever room is available.  If a sewage leak is found, you\'ll be downgraded to an even crappier room. If they claim to comp anything get it in writing because they don\'t honor their word. If they offer you a later check out time, make sure they re-key your cards and maintenance is informed.

No Ash Tray, No Cups, No Bible (and yes I read it especially in Las Vegas). The A/C in the room hardly worked at all, the hallway was cooler. I noticed the floor looked dirty and what initially appeared to be rust around the base of the plastic bath tub. I put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly and figured out that housekeeping did a lousy job or the toilet was simply left overflowed for a few days and never cleaned up hence the stains. \n\nIDC if the rooms are either free or next to free but I may just start paying to stay where I play when they don\'t comp me.

I was afraid to cancel and get new reservations in case they were booked. When we arrived we asked if we could have the lower rate and were told we should have cancelled our original one and got a new one. sigh ... Anyway the accommidations were nice.
